                Snuggles enjoys long walks on the beach while the sun is down (he likes to blend into the background so predators don't see him!). 
				<br>His favorite past time is watching youtube videos of seahorses as well as playing water polo with his family. 
				<br>Snuggles also very much enjoys - you guessed it - diving! (no, he doesnt enjoy snuggling).
